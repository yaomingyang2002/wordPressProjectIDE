This package include scotchbox and wpdistillery files into a wordPressProject folder, so that you can repeatly use this package to setup different wordPressProject (just change the folder name, so you will have an isolated wordpress environment for individual project without infering other project runing in your machine!)

what you need to run this package to set up a WP IDE:
1. install a oracle virtural machine and vagrant box in your PC .
2. change the wordPressProject folder name to whatever project name you want and move to where you have installed your vagrant box (usually in C:\Users\username\WordPressProject).
3. follow the install instruction in the following link (https://scotch.io/bar-talk/announcing-wpdistillery-dead-simple-wordpress-for-scotch-box)

	a. all required files are already in the folder now.
	b. Start your virtual machine by running vagrant up and access the Scotch Box with vagrant ssh (PUTTY)
	c. Make sure WP-CLI is up to date(so you will run the latest version of wordpress!): 
				sudo wp cli update --allow-root  
	d. Execute the setup.sh: 
				cd ../../var/www/ && bash setup.sh
	e. modify your hosts file in the path: 
				c/window/system32/drivers/etc/hosts
	   just add one line to the hosts file: 
	   			192.168.33.10  wpdistillery.dev
	f. now run your browser: 
					wpdistillery.dev/wp-login.php 
					(username: admin /password: admin, you can modify these in the config.yml file directly.)
					
	g. now your wordpress environment is setup. 
	h. Here are 3 Fixes need to do after the basic setup. You need to run http://wpdistillery.net/wp-login.php 

		1) Disable Comments plugins => adjust it to check Pages and Medias, and uncheck ‘Posts’ (otherwise you cannot create comments!)

		2) Theme => The basic theme of WPDistillery is broken, you may install a new one by going to the Apperance section, Add a New Theme. Then, select Tweenty Sixteen, click Install, then click Activate.

		3) Permalinks are broken, and need to be regenerated. Go to Settings => Permalinks, then click 'Save Changes' after switching from Post-title to Numeric, and back to Post-title.
		 
	i. now you are ready to go just focusing on your wordPress project!
