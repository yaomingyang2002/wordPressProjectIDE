This package includes documents needed to quickly setup individual WordPress Project Integrated Development Enviroment (IDE) for website development based on Scotch BOX (LAMP) over Vagrant - Oracle VM. It can be used to create multiple IDEs each for a specific project using latest version (4.6.1) of WordPress Content Management System (CMS) over your VM.

This package combine Scotchbox and WPDistillery files into a single folder, so that it can be repeatly used to setup multiple IDEs for those with multi-tasks and work on different wordPressProjects (each time just make a copy of the folder and change the folder name to your project name, so you can setup an isolated wordpress IDE using that copy for an individual project) and  save a lot of time from repeatedly searching files online and figuring out how to install it from beginning again.

What you will need to do with this package to set up a WordPress IDE:

1. install an Oracle VirturalBox and Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/) in your PC .

2. change the wordPressProject folder name to whatever project name you want and move to where you have installed your Vagrant (e.g.  c:\Users\username\yourWordPressProject).

3. follow the install instruction in the following link (https://scotch.io/bar-talk/announcing-wpdistillery-dead-simple-wordpress-for-scotch-box):

	a. All required files are already included in this folder now.
	b. Start your virtual machine by running vagrant up (note the ssh parameters) and access to the Scotch Box with vagrant ssh (e.g. using PUTTY).

	c. Make sure WP-CLI is up to date(so you will run the latest version of wordpress!): 
				sudo wp cli update --allow-root 

	d. Execute the setup.sh: 
				cd ../../var/www/ && bash setup.sh

	e. modify hosts file in the path: 

				c/window/system32/drivers/etc/hosts
	   just add one line to the hosts file: 
	   			192.168.33.10  wpdistillery.dev

	f. now run browser and login to admin page: 
					wpdistillery.dev/wp-login.php 
					(username: admin /password: admin, these can be changed in the config.yml file directly.)
					

	g. now your wordpress environment is setup. 
	h. Here are 3 Fixes need to do after the basic setup. You need to run http://wpdistillery.net/wp-login.php 

		1) Disable Comments plugins => adjust it to check Pages and Medias, and uncheck ‘Posts’ (otherwise you cannot create comments!)

		2) Theme => The basic theme of WPDistillery is broken, you may install a new one by going to the Apperance section, Add a New Theme. Then, select Tweenty Sixteen, click Install, then click Activate.

		3) Permalinks are broken, and need to be regenerated. Go to Settings => Permalinks, then click 'Save Changes' after switching from Post-title to Numeric, and back to Post-title.
		 
	i. now you are ready to go just focusing on your wordPress project!
